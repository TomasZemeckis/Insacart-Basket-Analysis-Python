# Insacart-Basket-Analysis-Python
I organised and examined multiple datasets for Instacart using Python. After that, I produced a report outlining my analysis methodology, findings, and suggestions in response to important Instacart business concerns.

## Objective
An app is used to operate the online grocery business Instacart. Although Instacart already has excellent sales, they still like to learn more about customers buying habits.

## Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## Data 
The project makes use of Instacart's open-source datasets in addition to bespoke consumer datasets. In order to answer the above business questions.
-  orders
- orders_products_prior
- products
- customers
- departments

#### The customer dataset and column 'prices' were added to the original data set for learning purposes of the Career Foundry course.

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
  
## Folders
- 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
